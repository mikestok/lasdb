LASDB - Love and Sex Database
=============================

Purpose
-------

This is a Ruby on Rails project for exploration.

Development
-----------

This uses git-flow for development.

As of 2011 04 24 issues and feature requests should go in Github - 
https://github.com/mikestok/lasdb/issues 

Git flow feature branches should be called _github-issue-_*n* where
the *n* is the issue number.

Currently as I'm the only person working on this the relases are
numbered *yyyy-mm-dd-*r*n* where *n* is the number of the release for
that day.

Backups
-------

See http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups for information on
the Heroku PGBackups add-on.

I have added database-backups/ to .gitignore so that I can stash the
backups on a development machine without polluting git.
